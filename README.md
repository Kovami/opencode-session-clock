# opencode-session-clock

A TUI plugin for OpenCode that shows how long the current session has been
running and how much of that time the agent was actually working.

## What it shows

- **Sidebar**: `Agent`, `Idle`, and `Total` time for the open session.
- **Composer**: a one-line summary above the prompt.
- **Timeline panel**: totals, the share of the session spent on agent work,
  and the last 12 agent steps with their duration and idle gap. Open it with
  `/time`.

Active time is the sum of assistant-message durations, from the moment a
request starts until its reply and tool work finish. Gaps between requests
count as idle, so time spent waiting for you never inflates the agent total.

## Install

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["opencode-session-clock@0.1.0"]
}
```

Restart is not required: OpenCode reloads the CLI configuration when the file
changes.

## Requirements

- OpenCode 2.2 or newer.
- No configuration and no credentials.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kovami/opencode-session-clock.git
cd opencode-session-clock
npm install
npm run check
```

To run a local checkout in OpenCode, point `cli.json` at the folder instead of
the npm name:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    { "package": "/absolute/path/to/opencode-session-clock" }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- Nothing appears: make sure the plugin is listed in `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`
  (the CLI configuration), not in `opencode.json`.
- OpenCode 2.2 or newer is required. After saving the config, check
  `~/.local/share/opencode/log/opencode.log` for `plugin` lines.
